## Summary
* **The main aim** is to get the knowledge and practical experience in front-end.
* Another important goal is to  improve my own technical background.
Since I work as a project manager I feel lack of technical knowledge and confidence while talking to developers.
I suppose this course will give me some technical basis. Thanks to this I'll be able to increase my professional value as a PM.
* _The last but not the least_, I've been dreaming of becoming a developer for many years. Though I don't have too much time to spend on self-education, I'll do my best and try to get as much knowledge and practice from this courser as possible.

**Unfortunately I don't any samples of code or apps and have never participated in projects as a developer.**
